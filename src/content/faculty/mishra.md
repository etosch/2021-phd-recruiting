area = "My research is in the broad field of Ubiquitous Computing and lies at the intersection of mobile/wearable sensing, human-centered computing, data science, and behavioral science. I am interested in developing data-driven sensing and intervention systems for smartphones and wearable devices. Specifically, I work on exploring and advancing the complete “lifecycle” of mental- and behavioral-health sensing and intervention, which includes (a) accurately sensing and detecting a mental or behavioral health condition, like stress and opioid use; (b) after detecting a particular condition, determining the right time to deliver the intervention or support, such that the user is most likely to be receptive to the interventions provided; and (c) choosing the best intervention delivery mechanism and modality to ensure just-in-time delivery and reachability."
