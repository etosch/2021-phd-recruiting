# Prospective Student Participants

This event is for individuals who are considering graduate school *and* who will be eligible to enter a graduate degree program by Fall 2022. We especially welcome folks from industry, atypical backgrounds, and current students looking to change their degree programs. 

This event scales with the number of recruiting faculty and core organizers. Therefore, it is possible that not everyone who applies will be able to attend. However, all content will be posted publicly after the event, and the Discord server we will be using during the event will be made public.
