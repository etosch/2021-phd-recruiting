# Logistics


This event will run on [Zoom](https://zoom.us) and [Discord](https://discord.com) with email communication via Google Group. Panels are all Q&A style and will happen on Zoom. The Discord server will be used for socializing (e.g., in a virtual Lobby), connecting students with text affinity groups, and meeting in small groups with recruiting faculty. 

The Discord server and Google group will be private prior to the event, but we will open them up for anyone to join after the event. 

__Please be sure to install these services prior to the event.__
