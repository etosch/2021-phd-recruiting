# Panelist Recruiting

We are currently <a href="https://forms.gle/CfgsS7MMvXwFQmtG9" style="background:purple; padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; border-radius: 5px;">seeking out panelists</a> who have the following characteristics:

1. Folks currently working *outside academia* who had *some research experience*, but decided that the PhD was not for them.
2. Folks currently working *outside academia* who have a PhD (we are especially interested in nontraditional paths).
3. *Current students*, including final-year undergraduates, Master's-level students and PhD students. **Note: we pay our student volunteers a $50 honorarium for their time out of faculty startup funds.**
4. Folks who speak on our <a href="#topical-panels">Topical Panels</a>.
