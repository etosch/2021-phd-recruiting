# Panelist Recruiting

We are currently [seeking out panelists](https://forms.gle/CfgsS7MMvXwFQmtG9) (not necessarily recruiting faculty) with the following characteristics:

1. Folks currently working *outside academia* who had *some research experience*, but decided that the PhD was not for them.
2. Folks currently working *outside academia* who have a PhD (we are especially interested in nontraditional paths).
3. *Current students*, including final-year undergraduates, Master's-level students and PhD students. **Note: we pay our student volunteers a $50 honorarium for their time out of faculty startup funds.**

Our [recruiting faculty form](https://forms.gle/Z87daquN3kjHiD7d6) will remain open until October 15; we currently have greater need for non-recruiting panelists.
