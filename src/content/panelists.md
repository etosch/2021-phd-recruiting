# Panelist Recruiting

We are currently <a href="https://forms.gle/CfgsS7MMvXwFQmtG9" style="background:purple; padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; border-radius: 5px;">seeking out panelists</a> who have the following characteristics:

1. Folks who "Mastered out" of a PhD program in a CS-ish field and are currently pursuing other interests.
2. Folks currently working *outside academia* who have a PhD (we are especially interested in nontraditional paths).
3. *Current students*, espeically *final-year undergraduates*, and *mid-career PhD students* (e.g., have just passed qualifying exams). **Note: we pay our student volunteers a $50 honorarium for their time out of faculty startup funds.**
4. Non-students who can speak on our <a href="#topical-panels">Topical Panels</a>.
