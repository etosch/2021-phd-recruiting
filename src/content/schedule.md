# Schedule
All times are listed as Eastern Daylight Time (GMT-4). _We recognize that many participants will be calling in from very different time zones. Unfortunately, we do not yet have the resources to multicast this event. We look forward to finding better solutions in the future._

## Welcome (8:45-9:15)
Profs. Brittany Johnson-Matthews and Emma Tosch welcome participants and give an overview of the day's purpose and plan. Participants should check that they are set up in their appropriate affinity groups. 

## General Sessions (9:30-11:25)

* *The PhD is a Job* (9:30-9:55). Panelists discuss the ways in which being a graduate student in a PhD program is more like a job than being a student. Potential topics include: pay, benefits, labor rights, expectations of work, differences in funding sources, and your supervisor's expectations.
* *The PhD is not a Job* (10:00-10:25). Panelists discuss the ways in which being a graduate student is not like a job, but rather like an apprenticeship. Potential topics include: mentorship, growth model, changing advisors, time commitments, and the role of service. 
* *Working toward mastery: technical skills* (10:30-10:55). Panelists discuss expectations of the technical skills students should have upon entering a PhD program and the expectation of growth vis-a-vis those skills. Possible topics include: methods for improving technical skills, and how to ask for help, and the role of courses in improving skills.
* *Working toward mastery: research skills* (11:00-11:25). Panelists discuss expectations of the research skills students should have upon entering a PhD program. *The objective of a PhD program is to train students to become independent researchers.* Possible topics include: what research actually is, how to learn research skills, best practices for improving research skills, how to advocate for yourself if you need help in this area.


## <a name="topical-panels"></a>Topical Panels (13:30-14:15)
Last year many students expressed an interest in specific areas of computer science and issues pertaining to the practice of computer science research. This year we will be offering topical panels to address any interest in these areas. *These two panels will run concurrently.*

* *Computer Science vs. Information Science vs. Data Science* (13:30-14:15). Computer Science as a discipline grew out of Mathematics and Engineering departments. Today we increasingly see computational methods in non-traditional fields. As more and more students desire to study non-traditional domains with traditional computing methods, many ask: what is the right home for me? In this panel we will discuss the differences between these programs and how to target your search if you are interested in interdisciplinary fields such as human-computer interaction, algorithmic fairness, and computational social science.

* *Scholarship, Identity, and Values-based Research* (13:30-14:15). Academia is often framed as not being a job, or even a profession, but a *vocation*. The implication in this statement is that academic researchers' work is often intertwined their their identities, both in terms of being scientists and scholars, and in the particulars of their work. Given the outsized role that technology plays in society, this relationship between self and work has changed rapidly. This panel will discuss how these topics interact. *Thanks to Nathan Dautenhahn for suggesting this topic.*

## Factuals and Counterfactuals (14:30-15:15)
Academic research and becoming a professor are often presented as the expected outcome of starting a PhD program. In this session's panels, we will hear from people who decided that this traditional path was not for them. *These three panels will run concurrently.*

* *Current Students* (14:30-15:15)
* *Master's degrees: intended terminus vs. "mastering out"* (14:30-15:15)
* *Post-PhD: The academy wasn't for me* (14:30-15:15)

## Open PhD student recruiting (15:30-16:30)
You can significantly improve your chances of being accepted to a PhD program by targeted faculty who are currently recruiting PhD students. Students should feel free to chat with professors for both advice and as part of the recruitment process. 

We will link short videos of our recruiting faculty explaining their research prior to the event. You can see the list of recruiting faculty below.

## Closing Remarks (16:45-17:00)
Profs. Brittany Johnson-Matthews and Emma Tosch discuss follow up and next steps.
