# Panelist Recruiting

We are currently [seeking out panelists](https://forms.gle/CfgsS7MMvXwFQmtG9) (not necessarily recruiting faculty) with the following characteristics:

1. Folks currently working *outside academia* who had *some research experience*, but decided that the PhD was not for them.
2. Folks currently working *outside academia* who have a PhD (we are especially interested in nontraditional paths).
3. *Current students*, including final-year undergraduates, Master's-level students and PhD students. **Note: we pay our student volunteers a $50 honorarium for their time out of faculty startup funds.**

Our [recruiting faculty form](https://forms.gle/Z87daquN3kjHiD7d6) will remain open until October 15; we currently have greater need for non-recruiting panelists.

# Prospective Student Participants

This event is for individuals who are considering graduate school *and* who will be eligible to enter a graduate degree program by Fall 2022. We especially welcome folks from industry, atypical backgrounds, and current students looking to change their degree programs. 

This event scales with the number of recruiting faculty and core organizers. Therefore, it is possible that not everyone who applies will be able to attend. However, all content will be posted publicly after the event, and the Discord server we will be using during the event will be made public.
